                <h1 style="margin-bottom: 50px">CS10 Course Overview</h1>
                <h4 class="syllabusSection">Welcome!</h4>
                    <div class="syllabusContent">Hello there and welcome to CS 10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing! We’re really excited to have you on board with us for a CS-filled summer where you’ll have your brains filled to the brim with the big ideas and impacts of computer science. Along the way, you’ll get exposure to the block-based language Snap!, and the popular Python, by solving interesting challenges with creative solutions, and even building your own personal project from the ground up! Prepare to have your brain stretched, your curiosity piqued, and yourself moderately caffeinated. This eight-week journey will move faster than you might anticipate, but you can trust that the staff will be here to guide your growth every step of the way. By the end of the class, we hope you walk away with a deeper understanding of the ideas that have come to define computer science, and the confidence to apply it in whichever field you choose to pursue.</div>
                <h4 class="syllabusSection">Your Summer Experience</h4>
                    <div class="syllabusContent">This summer, we’re really focusing on how to deliver a high-quality learning experience alongside the shift to a remote format. We also want to make sure that students have a consistent venue where you can interact with instructors, TAs, and their peers in smaller, more intimate settings. While we’ll dive into the nitty gritty of it in a second, you can expect this semester to include: regular one-on-one meetings with your TA, a big emphasis on small-group work, fewer deadlines, and a shift away from delivering content via Zoom. </div>
                    <div class="syllabusSubsection">Your CS10 Family</div>
                        <div class="syllabusContent">One thing that defines CS10 is the variety of people and stories coming together to experience computer science for the first time. Staff-wise, your instructors, TAs, readers, and academic interns represent a variety of technical and non-technical majors, including Cognitive Science, Conservation & Resource Studies, Sociology, and Theater and Performing Arts! Furthermore, CS10 consistently has the most diverse group of students out of any computer science course here on campus. As you settle into CS10, you’ll get a chance to meet and connect with all the amazing individuals (that includes yourself!) in the class. More importantly, we hope that you feel comfortable reaching out to this community on Piazza, by email, or via Zoom, whether it’s to get some help with the content, or simply to share your excitement about the topics we’ve covered.</div>
                <h4 class="syllabusSection">Syllabus Overview</h4>
                    <div class="syllabusContent" style="margin-bottom: 5px;">We’ll be talking about the following in the rest of the syllabus:</div>

                    <h4 class="syllabusSection">Sections</h4>
                        <div class="syllabusSubsection">Flipped Lecture</div>
                            <div class="syllabusContent">This semester, we’ll mainly be delivering content through BJCx videos, which is essentially the national version of CS10. Instead of delivering a lecture via Zoom we’ll be taking a flipped classroom approach, spending our time reinforcing and diving deeper into the content talked about in the videos. We highly recommend watching the videos prior to attending these sections as we will be building upon the content, not reviewing them, so you might feel quite lost during these sections if you haven’t done so.</div>
                        <div class="syllabusSubsection">Discussion</div>
                            <div class="syllabusContent">Discussions are similar to flipped lecture sections, but the material covered dives deeper into the content to prepare you for exam-level questions. These occur on Tuesdays and Thursdays with your assigned TA. There’s also a worksheet that accompanies these sections that prepare you for exam-level material.</div>
                        <div class="syllabusSubsection">Labs</div>
                            <div class="syllabusContent">Labs are open work sessions where there will be a TA and academic interns (AIs) who can help you out with your problem sets and projects. Note that while TAs and AIs are all capable of answering content related questions, questions related to course logistics are best left for TAs. There will be multiple work sessions that take place each day to accommodate differences in time zones. Feel free to attend multiple if you’d simply like to spend more time working on assignments! Conceptual questions are welcome, but better left for office hours — the primary focus  of these sections will be completing assignments!</div>
                        <div class="syllabusSubsection">Office Hours</div>
                            <div class="syllabusContent">Office hours are optional sections hosted by TAs, where you can ask general questions regarding the class, assignments, and content. Timing of these sections depends largely on instructors and TAs, but we try to adjust when we host these sections based on feedback. You’ll be able to view these hours on the course website under our weekly calendar section.</div>
                        <div class="syllabusSubsection">Check-ins</div>
                            <div class="syllabusContent">Check-ins are short, weekly meetings you’ll have with your TA, where you can have a conversation with them about how you’re doing, how you’re feeling about the course and content, and anything else you’d like to talk about, really! We just want to make sure you’re doing well and feeling good about the course. These check-ins shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes, and will happen primarily on Fridays. If that’s not a good day for you though, feel welcome to reach out via email (found on the course website) and we’ll find something that works.</div>
                        <div class="syllabusSubsection">Social Implication Sessions</div>
                            <div class="syllabusContent">CS10 isn’t just a class that teaches programming! We also want to discuss the various impacts of computer science  and how they affect our broader society. As part of this goal, we’ll be having weekly readings and/or videos for you to check out regarding specific social implications topics. On Fridays, we’ll be having hour-long discussions pertaining to these weekly topics. If you don’t feel like this is the best venue to share your thoughts though, fret not! There’s an optional reading response you can do instead of having to attend these sessions.</div>
