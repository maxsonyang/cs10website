UC Berkeley was one of the two universities I applied to in the US, though I had never imagined living and studying in California. I ended up picking Berkeley because I enjoy the breadth of the education, the specific programs available, and the opportunity to experience a new place.",
    "experience" : "I had some basic experience with programming (think \"Hello World\") and a shallow understanding of OOP before coming to Cal. CS10 helped me delve into the practical side of problem-solving and programming so I became more confident in my abilities and understanding of many foundational topics. I have also taken CS61A and Data 8 during my time at Cal.",

export const kellyannBio = {
    "backstory" : "I grew up in the South Bay in this really architecturally flat suburb, spending my time on thingslike reading books instead of going outside, and thinking about wearing suits without actuallydoing it. I had a brief stint as a tee-ball player that involved a lot of eating Big League Chew outof my uniform pocket, followed by a less brief stint as a member of my high school’s colorguard.I started here as an Integrative Biology major, and then did horribly in General Chemistry, whichwas very demoralizing. Conveniently, that same semester I did not-horribly in both CS10 (<3)and the introductory technical theater class (THR60, highly recommend). So now, because Iimprint really fast, I’m majoring in L&S CS and Theater and Performance Studies with a focus inarts management",
    "experience" : "I have done a.. non-zero amount of programming.(I’m somewhat fluent in the languages taught in the CS prereq classes, and last semester Isquished some C into my brain. I’m still most comfortable in Python and Java, though.)",
    "hobbies" : "I didn’t really ... have any hobbies until last summer, when I started setting aside time in earnestto become the kind of socially awkward artist type that I’d always admired from a distance. Ipicked up fiction writing and cooking, though the cooking is mainly so I eat, and the writing is theonly one that stuck. I make myself sit down and put words in a Google Doc twice a week for twohours in the afternoon, and occasionally while I’m doing that I have a good time.I’ve recently started reading, mostly fiction. Mostly YA fiction because ‘New Adult’ is a genre thatdoesn’t get written for alot. Please send me book recommendations if you like, it is genuinelyokay if we have not interacted a lot in person — if you email me about a book you like,congratulations! We will have interacted more.",
    "talents" : "Agh, this is the same question I ask myself whenever I sit down to edit my resume. The roteresponse is: communication, conflict negotiation, creative thinking, etc. The non-rote responseis: storytelling, moving through difficult conversations, not holding a grudge.I am also very good at shouting when I’m excited, taking pictures of food I make, getting reallynervous before texting friends to make plans, and becoming overly attached to works of fiction.",
    "remarkableStuff" : "I suppose I have done a series of things that would be considered denotatively remarkable bygeneral society and which for that reason live on my resume. I have also done other far moreemotionally interesting things: getting my hair cut short (and later cutting my own hair so itstayed short), putting my writing on the internet for strangers to look at, raising my hand indiscussion to ask the TA to repeat themself please.The most memorable thing that has happened to me is one time my roommates and I made aspontaneous short film about me eating walnuts. I certainly didn’t actively pursue that one.",
    "commitments" : "I am, of course, doing reader-y things for CS10 this summer. I’m taking two classes - EE16Band a short fiction writing workshop that I’m nervous-excited for. I’d say for 16B I’m 87%nervous and 13% excited, but for the writing workshop we’re at an even 50-50."
